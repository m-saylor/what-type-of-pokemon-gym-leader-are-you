  <p>This program is a quiz that tells you which type of gym leader you would be in the fictional universe of Pokemon.</p>
  <p>The quiz has 7 questions with a varying number of answer options for each. </p>
  <p>Each answer corresponds to one or multiple outcomes and increments the total points towards the outcome accordingly. </p>

## How to Use
Simply answer each question and click the submit button to see your results. If you don't answer all of the questions, you will receive an error message and will have to finish the quiz. 
Upon viewing your results, you can close the modal, reset your answers to take the quiz again, or share your results.

## Specifications
- The '/src' file contains all of the files necessary to run the program.
- The program imports data for the questions, answers, images, outcomes, and anything specific to the quiz via a JSON file, named 'data.json.' Thus, the code could be reused for any future quiz.
- 'main.js' contains the javascript necessary for the page interactivity, which is a mixture of both native JS and jQuery.
